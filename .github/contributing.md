# Contributing to Transcriptase

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Semantic Release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release)

We use semantic versioning for commit messages.

For commit messages, use semantig writing:

| Commit                                             |      Usage       | Version |
| -------------------------------------------------- | :--------------: | ------- |
| fix(your-change): a small change, maybe just a fix |   Fix Release    | v.0.0.1 |
| feat(your-change): a new feature, a medium change  | Feature Release  | v.0.1.0 |
| perf(your-change): a breaking change or hotfix     | Breaking Release | v.1.0.0 |

## We Use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs or added new dependencies, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Use semantic versioning for commits.
7. Issue a pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/Se-Gl/greenCSS-frontend/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes, Screenshots

People _love_ thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

- You can try running `npm run lint` and `npm run prettier` for style unification
